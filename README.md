# 🔗 Linktree Clone – Express + TypeScript

> 🚀 A Linktree-style web app built with the MERN stack + TypeScript  
> **Status**: Initial Commit – setting up the project structure and tooling

## 🧠 Project Overview

**StackLink** is a full-stack application where users can register, personalize, and share their own link pages, much like Linktree. This project is being built as part of a course on modern full-stack development using **Express**, **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**.

Key user features will include:
- User authentication (JWT-based)
- Profile creation with custom handles
- Link management (add/edit/remove/sort social links)
- Avatar upload via Cloudinary
- Live public preview pages
- Admin panel with form validation and toast notifications
- Optimistic updates and caching with React Query

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + React Router + TailwindCSS + React Hook Form + React Query (TanStack)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) + TypeScript
- **Auth**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) + Cookies or LocalStorage
- **File Uploads**: Cloudinary + Formidable
- **Dev Tools**: Axios, Nodemon, ESLint, Prettier

## 🧠 Why I'm Building This

This project is part of my transition to a full-stack role with a focus on modern web technologies. I’m using it to:
- Practice core backend skills with Node/Express
- Learn API security (authentication, input validation)
- Structure a real-world project in a clean, modular way
